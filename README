Work-in-progress "voxel" game or game engine.

Probably you won't be able to compile/use it without my help. The repo doesn't
include assets used in testing (fonts, gui skin, textures, cursors). And it
depends on a number of specific libraries, which are not included either.

Here for educational purposes, the license is BSD for now. Could be altered in
future.
